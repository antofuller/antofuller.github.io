I am a Ph.D. student at Carleton University, supervised by <a href='[#](http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/green/green.php)'>Jim Green</a>. I am broadly interested in deep learningâ€”a *bit* more specifically, I am interested in self-supervised learning, transformers, multimodal applications, and interpretability.

I have a B.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering (2015) and an M.A.Sc. in Systems and Computer Engineering (2023), both from Carleton University.
